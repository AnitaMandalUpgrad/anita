# Anita

Anita is a private, no-server, powerful and fully customizable data management solution, open source and free of charge. 

With Anita you can organize any number of things you want to track, with one of our pre-configured Anita Templates or by defining your own custom data structure. 

Anita can handle many different data types, and can present your data in multiple useful ways.

### Portable

Your data is stored on your computer in a JSON file and/or on a remote database of your choice: flexible, open & no lock-in. Stay independent from servers that will go away, sooner or later.

### Secure

There is no risk of a data breach like there is with cloud based solutions: Anita works fully offline. You keep your data where it's most safe, with you.

### Private

Anita is the privacy you want, the convenience you need. It fully works without any cloud, so your data is never exposed to a third party: no more middlemen, profiling or ads targeting.

## Anita is still in Beta

Anita is still in early beta, we are improving it daily to add features and customization options.

As we move forward we will make available our current roadmap, as of now our next big milestone is reaching v. 1.0.0.

Our goal for version 1.0.0 is to implement the following:

- support for child and parent sections to link items of different sections;
- possibility to exclude certain sections from the main menu: useful for child sections to be displayed only as a subsection of a parent element;
- addition of a tab view for child sections;
- Anita templates (at least one example template); 
- support for saving data locally in the browser's IndexedDB (with [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/));
- support for synchronization of locally stored data with one or more remote databases connected directly to the PWA, without intermediaries (serverless/no-server). Priority development for (in order of priority):
  - [DexieCloud](https://dexie.org/cloud/)
  - MongoDB
  - MySQL
